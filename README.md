Project 1 6/20/23

## Description
The motivation behind this project was having personal experiences dealing with anxiety, depression and mental health. We've built this project to have it be a resource or a place to fall on when dealing with difficult emotions. We've structured this site to have the user express what they are going through, and providing alternative distractions that may help calm, heal and maybe even make someone smile. We learned that even a simple site can be laborious but we enjoyed piecing things together to make it work. We are aware that there is room for a lot of improvements, and hope that after we become more educated in coding, that we can come back and make this site better, more user friendly, safe with security measures, and with the user being able to  store in a cloud and not in local storage, where if they clear the browser history and cache , how everything disappears. 

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
Landing Page:
Upon arriving to the landing page, the user is instructed to "Click on scale to log how you're feeling today". Their input value will be logged in the journal area. Depending on what they press (1-3, 4-6, 7-10) they will encounter a modal. 1-3 is in the red zone and provides resources and links in the pop up modal. 4-6 is the yellow zone and modal asks user "Would you like to take a minute to breathe?". The user then has an option to press on button to either navigate to the timer, or navigate to the journal. 7-10 is the green zone, and congratulates the user for feeling better, and also gives the option if user would like to " journal your feelings, or maybe exercise your breathing!". User can navigate to resources, timer, and journal through navigation bar. We provide music from youtube that may help de-stress or calm anxiety, and also giphys to perhaps make a user smile. 

Resource:
List phone numbers, and chat sites that can help de-escalate issues. There are hotlines in suicide, domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, translife, and veterans crisis. 

Timer:
Is an automatic breathing timer, once it counts down from 60 to 0, the user has an option to reset and start over. 

Journal: 
Has an add button that the user can press. They enter date, title and text . Their input will be saved and displayed in journal entry area. The input of the feelings gauge is also displayed on this page. User has option to delete things if they want to.
